-- Brief synopsis of your project's features --
Our project is the web sudoku app, in which users can sign up and log in to play the sudoku game. From the pre-loaded puzzles, users will notice that the puzzles get harder as progress is made. When users log out, the user's progress is saved to the last completed puzzle. 

Users can also request a hint, which will trigger the solver algorithm that we have developed, and it will return a proper answer on a blank tile. When user puts a bad input on a tile (same in row, same in col, same in box), an error message shows up, along with highlighting the bad tile.

-- How to launch / operate your project --
First, you need to configure your `Config.py` to your AWS Dynamodb credential. Afterwards in the directory of `Sudoku.py`, run `$ export FLASK_APP=Sudoku.py`. Then `flask run` to start the server.

By default, the server will start at localhost:5000, and from there, you can log in or sign up to start playing the game.
